# MYTHRA Glyph Generator

This project uses Replicate to generate sacred dream glyphs from symbolic prompts using a fine-tuned LoRA model called `matrka_glyph_1`.

## ðŸ”® What It Does

Given symbolic inputâ€”such as an entity, an emotion, and an elementâ€”the model produces black-and-white glyphs in a sacred, trance-inspired visual style.

Example:
Entity: Falcon
Emotion: Insight
Element: Wind
