  "prompt": "meru archetypal symbol of a wolf, bold angular silhouette of a wolf's head in profile, prominent pointed ears, elongated snout, open howling mouth, upward energy, primal wildness, pure black ink on white background, high contrast monochrome, no colors, no grays, recognizable yet abstract symbolic form, clear archetypal meaning, bold black strokes, sharp defined edges, strong silhouette, maximum contrast, iconic symbolic representation, perfect for SVG conversion, universally recognizable wolf archetype",
  "interpretation": "Dreaming of a wolf might invite you to reconnect with instinct, courage, or the wilder edges of your nature. Jung and Hillman might suggest the wolf points toward autonomous, untamed energies within\u2014the parts of yourself that know how to survive and protect. Mythologically, as Campbell and Est\u00e9s show, the wolf often appears as a companion in the dark woods of the soul, a guide to intuition and hidden knowing. In some traditions, the wolf may act as an initiator or psychopomp, ushering you into a new level of awareness or testing your authenticity. Esoteric sources might associate the wolf with the threshold between worlds, a being at home in both light and shadow. In nondual teachings, the wolf\u2019s howl could be a call to recognize your own fierce presence as both form and emptiness. If the wolf visits your dream, you might ask what is calling for courage or protection in your life\u2014and consider how you relate to both solitude and belonging.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Est\u00e9s, Grof, Campbell, Meade, Wilber, ARAS, and others.",
