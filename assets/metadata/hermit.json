  "name": "Hermit",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Encountering the hermit in dreams or visions may signal a call to explore solitary seeking and inner illumination. Jung might see the hermit as an archetypal pattern of human development, while Hillman could explore its role in personal myth-making and soul-work. Mythologically, the hermit appears across cultures as a symbol of solitude, inner light. Esoteric traditions might frame it as a key to understanding solitary seeking and inner illumination. If the hermit appears in your experience, consider what aspects of solitary seeking and inner illumination are seeking attention in your life.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, and archetypal wisdom traditions.",
