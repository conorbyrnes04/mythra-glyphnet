  "name": "Infinity",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Encountering the infinity in dreams or visions may signal a call to explore eternal cycles and boundless continuity. Jung might interpret the infinity as a symbol of individuation and wholeness, while Hillman could see it as an invitation to engage with the sacred dimensions of psyche. Mythologically, the infinity appears across cultures as a symbol of eternal, endless. Esoteric traditions might frame it as a key to understanding eternal cycles and boundless continuity. If the infinity appears in your experience, consider what aspects of eternal cycles and boundless continuity are seeking attention in your life.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, and archetypal wisdom traditions.",
