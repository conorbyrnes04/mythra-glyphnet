  "name": "Mother",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Encountering the mother in dreams or visions may signal a call to explore nurturing protection and creative love. Jung might see the mother as an archetypal pattern of human development, while Hillman could explore its role in personal myth-making and soul-work. Mythologically, the mother appears across cultures as a symbol of nurturing, protection. Esoteric traditions might frame it as a key to understanding nurturing protection and creative love. If the mother appears in your experience, consider what aspects of nurturing protection and creative love are seeking attention in your life.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, and archetypal wisdom traditions.",
