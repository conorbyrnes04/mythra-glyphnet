  "name": "Tree",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Encountering the tree in dreams or visions may signal a call to explore rooted wisdom and life axis connection. Jung might see the tree as connecting us to natural wisdom, while Hillman could explore its role in re-enchanting our relationship with the living world. Mythologically, the tree appears across cultures as a symbol of growth, connection. Esoteric traditions might frame it as a key to understanding rooted wisdom and life axis connection. If the tree appears in your experience, consider what aspects of rooted wisdom and life axis connection are seeking attention in your life.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, and archetypal wisdom traditions.",
