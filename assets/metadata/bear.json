  "name": "Bear",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Meeting the bear in dreams might point to a time for retreat, protection, or inner healing. Jung and Hillman might interpret the bear as an invitation to draw on your own rooted strength and to honor the wisdom found in solitude. Across cultures, the bear is sometimes seen as an ancestor, a healer, or a guardian of hidden knowledge. Myths might depict the bear as a teacher of boundaries, renewal, or the cyclical rhythms of life and rest. Esoteric writers sometimes see the bear as a symbol of deep transformation\u2014of returning to the earth to emerge renewed. Nondual traditions may recognize in the bear a spaciousness or luminous holding, inviting you to rest in the fullness of being. If bear energy appears to you, consider where you might need to honor cycles of activity and retreat, or how you might draw upon protective or nurturing instincts.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Est\u00e9s, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, Mindell, and others.",
