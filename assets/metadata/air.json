  "name": "Air",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Encountering the air in dreams or visions may signal a call to explore intellectual freedom and breath of life. Jung would likely connect the air to fundamental psychic energies, while Hillman might explore its role in emotional alchemy and transformation. Mythologically, the air appears across cultures as a symbol of intellect, communication. Esoteric traditions might frame it as a key to understanding intellectual freedom and breath of life. If the air appears in your experience, consider what aspects of intellectual freedom and breath of life are seeking attention in your life.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, and archetypal wisdom traditions.",
