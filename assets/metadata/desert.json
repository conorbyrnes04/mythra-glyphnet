  "name": "Desert",
  "meaning": "",
  "interpretation": "Encountering the desert in dreams or visions may signal a call to explore purifying solitude and visionary emptiness. Jung might see the desert as connecting us to natural wisdom, while Hillman could explore its role in re-enchanting our relationship with the living world. Mythologically, the desert appears across cultures as a symbol of solitude, purification. Esoteric traditions might frame it as a key to understanding purifying solitude and visionary emptiness. If the desert appears in your experience, consider what aspects of purifying solitude and visionary emptiness are seeking attention in your life.\n\n\u2014 Inspired by Jung, Hillman, Campbell, Grof, ARAS, and archetypal wisdom traditions.",
