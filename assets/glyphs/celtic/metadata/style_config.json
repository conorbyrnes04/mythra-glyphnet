Incorporate swirling, spiral patterns, knotwork, and stylized eyes. The design should be dynamic, highly abstract yet recognizable, rich in tribal and Celtic-inspired ornament, with strong contrast and a sense of ritual power. Channel the energy of sacred geometry, illuminated manuscripts, and visionary art. No text, no color except gold, strong silhouette, suitable for tattoo or SVG icon.",
