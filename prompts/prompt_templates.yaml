# Prompt templates for MYTHRA glyph generation
Generate a [MYTHRA] glyph that symbolizes the essence of a dreamseed formed from the following:

- Entity: {entity}
- Element: {element}
- Emotion: {emotion}

This [MYTHRA] glyph should:

– Be etched in radiant gold or shimmering metallic ink on a black background  
– Use precise, clean, resonant linework, like sacred geometry or trance-drawn calligraphy  
– Emanate archetypal power: spirals, radial symmetry, elemental flow, symbolic portals  
– Evoke the spirit of ancient sigils, cave carvings, tantric yantras, and celestial inscriptions  
– Glow softly, as if illuminated from within by the energy of {emotion} and the movement of {element}  
– Serve as a living symbol: both map and magnet for transformation  
– A glyph worthy of being painted on the body, engraved on stone, or projected into dreamspace

**Visual style:**  
Golden ink or luminous brass lines on matte black stone or parchment. Thin but radiant curves, geometrically aligned with mythic symbols. Clear central motif (eye, flame, spiral, seed), nested within circular energy fields or cardinal directions.
